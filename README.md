This program uses the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) python library to preprocess text, by first tokenizing the text and then removing stop words and non-alphabetic charachters, lemmatizing, and extracting nouns. It randomly selects one of these nouns in a guessing game. To run the program make sure to set the filepath of your data as a sys arg.
