Portfolio for CS 4395.

Here is a link to my [Overview of NLP](https://github.com/TediDika/Portfolio/blob/2e020b2ac6798997eac8dca945fe975800562157/Overview%20of%20NLP.pdf)


## Assignment 1

[Link to overview](https://github.com/TediDika/Portfolio/blob/main/Homework1/Overview%20of%20Assignment%201.pdf)

In [this assignment](https://github.com/TediDika/Portfolio/blob/main/Homework1/Homework1_txd190008.py) I gained experience with processing text from a csv file using regex and pickling files in python.

## Assignment 2
[Link to code](https://github.com/TediDika/Portfolio/blob/main/Homework2/Homework2_txd190008.py)

This program uses the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) python library to preprocess text, by first tokenizing the text and then removing stop words and non-alphabetic charachters, lemmatizing, and extracting nouns. It randomly selects one of these nouns in a guessing game. To run the program make sure to set the filepath of your data as a sys arg.

## Assignment 3
[Link to notebook](https://github.com/TediDika/Portfolio/blob/main/Homework3.ipynb)

Exploring the WordNet and SentiWordNet functions like word similarity, sentiment analysis, and collocation identification.

## Assignment 4
This assignment uses n-grams to predict which langauge given text is in. This assignment has two programs. The [first program](https://github.com/TediDika/Portfolio/blob/main/Homework4/program1.py) creates bigram and unigram dictionaries for English, French, and Italian using the provided training data where the key is the unigram or bigram text and the value is the count of that unigram or bigram in the data. The [second program](https://github.com/TediDika/Portfolio/blob/main/Homework4/program2.py) feeds in the test data and calculates probabilities for each language line-by-line and outputs accuracy. [This narrative](https://github.com/TediDika/Portfolio/blob/main/Homework4/Assignment%204%20-%20Narrative.pdf) delves deeper into the utility of n-grams.

## Assignment 5
In [this document](https://github.com/TediDika/Portfolio/blob/main/Homework5/parsing.pdf) I use PSG, SRT, and dependecy parsing to parse a sentence, and talk about the pros and cons of each method.

## Assignment 6
In [this assignment](https://github.com/TediDika/Portfolio/blob/main/Homework6/web_crawler.py) I use web crawling and scraping to form a knowledge base. [Overview](https://github.com/TediDika/Portfolio/blob/main/Homework6/Overview%20of%20Assignment6.pdf)

## Assignment 7
In [this assignment](https://github.com/TediDika/Portfolio/blob/main/Homework7/Assignment7.ipynb) I learned how to perform text proccesing and classfication using three different methods: Naive Bayes, Linear Regression, and Neural Networks.

## Assignment 8
In [this essay](https://github.com/TediDika/NLP-Portfolio/blob/main/Homework8/ACL%20Paper%20Summary.pdf) I summarized the ACL Paper 'Automated Crossword Solving" the paper discusses applying machine learning NLP techniques to a crossword solving bot. The bot was entered into a top national crossword solving competition and was the first computer program to beat all human competitors.

## Assignment 9
In [this assignment](https://github.com/TediDika/NLP-Portfolio/blob/main/Homework9/chatbot.py) I built a chatbot named SweetBot that will generate dessert recipes. The bot will save and remember the users name and food allergies into a csv file. It will extract the user's name with spaCy NER and the user's food allergies with NLTK POS Tagging from given input. Finally the bot makes API calls to GPT-3.5-Turbo to utilize its extensive knowledge base.
