# NLP Portfolio
Portfolio for CS 4395.

[Click here](./ResumePage.md) to see the technical and soft skills I gained from this class.

## Overview of NLP
Here is a link to my [Overview of NLP](https://github.com/TediDika/Portfolio/blob/2e020b2ac6798997eac8dca945fe975800562157/Overview%20of%20NLP.pdf)

## Assignment 1 - Text Processing
In [this assignment](https://github.com/TediDika/Portfolio/blob/main/Homework01/Homework1_txd190008.py) I gained experience with processing text from a csv file using regex and pickling files in python. [Link to overview](https://github.com/TediDika/Portfolio/blob/main/Homework01/Overview%20of%20Assignment%201.pdf)

## Assignment 2 - Word Guessing Game
[This program](https://github.com/TediDika/Portfolio/blob/main/Homework02/Homework2_txd190008.py) uses the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) python library to preprocess text, by first tokenizing the text and then removing stop words and non-alphabetic charachters, lemmatizing, and extracting nouns. It randomly selects one of these nouns in a guessing game. To run the program make sure to set the filepath of your data as a sys arg.

## Assignment 3 - WordNet
In this [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/TediDika/NLP-Portfolio/blob/main/Homework03/Homework3.ipynb) I explore the NLTK WordNet and SentiWordNet functions and how we can use them to allow machines to understand relationships between text and perform functions like word similarity, sentiment analysis, and collocation identification.

## Assignment 4 - N-Gram Language Model
This assignment uses n-grams to predict which langauge given text is in. This assignment has two programs. The [first program](https://github.com/TediDika/Portfolio/blob/main/Homework04/program1.py) creates bigram and unigram dictionaries for English, French, and Italian using the provided training data where the key is the unigram or bigram text and the value is the count of that unigram or bigram in the data. The [second program](https://github.com/TediDika/Portfolio/blob/main/Homework04/program2.py) feeds in the test data and calculates probabilities for each language line-by-line and outputs accuracy. [This narrative](https://github.com/TediDika/Portfolio/blob/main/Homework04/Assignment%204%20-%20Narrative.pdf) delves deeper into the utility of n-grams.

## Assignment 5 - Parsing Sentences
In [this document](https://github.com/TediDika/Portfolio/blob/main/Homework05/parsing.pdf) I use PSG, SRT, and dependecy parsing to parse a sentence, and talk about the pros and cons of each method.

## Assignment 6 - Web Crawler
In [this assignment](https://github.com/TediDika/Portfolio/blob/main/Homework06/web_crawler.py) I use web crawling and scraping to form a knowledge base for future use in a chatbot. [Link to overview](https://github.com/TediDika/Portfolio/blob/main/Homework06/Overview%20of%20Assignment6.pdf)

## Assignment 7 - Text Classification
In [this assignment](https://github.com/TediDika/Portfolio/blob/main/Homework07/Assignment7.ipynb) I learned how to perform text proccesing and classfication using three different methods: Naive Bayes, Linear Regression, and Neural Networks. My goal was to classify the text related to either Physics or Biology using a Kaggle dataset of social media comments.

## Assignment 8 - Automated Crossword Solving
In [this essay](https://github.com/TediDika/NLP-Portfolio/blob/main/Homework08/ACL%20Paper%20Summary.pdf) I summarized the ACL Paper 'Automated Crossword Solving" the paper discusses applying machine learning NLP techniques to a crossword solving bot. The bot was entered into a top national crossword solving competition and was the first computer program to beat all human competitors.

## Assignment 9 - Chatbot
In [this assignment](https://github.com/TediDika/NLP-Portfolio/blob/main/Homework09/chatbot.py) I built a chatbot named SweetBot that will generate dessert recipes. The bot will save and remember the users name along with their food allergies into a csv file. It will extract the user's name with spaCy NER and the user's food allergies with NLTK POS Tagging from given input. Finally the bot makes API calls to GPT-3.5-Turbo to utilize its extensive knowledge base.

## Assignment 10 - Deep Learning Text Classification
In [this assignment](https://github.com/TediDika/NLP-Portfolio/blob/main/Homework10/TextClassification2.ipynb) I learned how to perform text classification using various deep learning models such as RNN, CNN, and embeddings. My goal was to classify tweets as being written by a male or female.

## Summary
Through this NLP class, I discovered the exciting potential of NLP to make a real-world impact. With each project, I gained hands-on experience with cutting-edge machine learning frameworks and technologies, including those used by virtual assistants, email spam filters, and chatbots like GPT. Looking ahead, I'm eager to explore ways that NLP can be leveraged to benefit my local community and loved ones through personal projects. To stay current with the rapidly-evolving field, I plan to use research papers and to attend NLP-related conferences. I am excited by the possibility of a career in NLP and the ever-growing possibilities of the field.
