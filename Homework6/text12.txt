The official website for the Attack on Titan anime announced on Friday that the television anime will be recompiled into two theatrical films. The first film, Shingeki no Kyojin Zenpen ~Guren no Yumiya~ (Attack on Titan Part I: Crimson Bow and Arrow), will open this winter. The second film, Shingeki no Kyojin Kōhen ~Jiyū no Tsubasa~ (Attack on Titan Part II: Wings of Freedom), will open next year. (The films are named after Linked Horizon's popular opening themes for the television anime.)



The new films will feature new dubbing and a 5.1ch remaster with returning voice cast members such as Yuuki Kaji (Eren Jaeger), Yui Ishikawa (Mikasa Ackerman), and Marina Inoue (Armin Arlelt). The first film will cover episodes 1 through 13, while the second film will cover 14 through 25. They will once again feature director Tetsuro Araki at Wit Studio and composer Hiroyuki Sawano. 



Hajime Isayama's hit original manga now has 36 million copies in circulation, and it inspired last year's television anime series. The first volume alone of the television anime has 100,000 copies. It is also inspiring next year's live-action film with lead actor Haruma Miura (Bloody Monday, Kimi ni Todoke) and director Shinji Higuchi (Heisei-era Gamera films).



The manga has also inspired four spinoff manga. Isayama launched the series in Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine in 2009.



Kodansha Comics is publishing Isayama's original manga in North America. The company is also releasing three of the four spinoff manga, and the Attack on Titan Guidebooks: INSIDE & OUTSIDE. Vertical is publishing the Attack on Titan: Before the Fall light novel series.



Both Funimation and Crunchyroll streamed the anime version of the manga as it aired in Japan, and Funimation is releasing the series on home video this year.
