A stage greeting event to celebrate the opening day of the Shingeki no Kyojin Zenpen ~Guren no Yumiya~ (Attack on Titan Part I: Crimson Bow and Arrow) film announced on Saturday that the television anime will get a second season in 2016. The event also announced that the second anime compilation film, Shingeki no Kyojin Kōhen ~Jiyū no Tsubasa~ (Attack on Titan Part II: Wings of Freedom), will open on June 27, 2015.



The film and television anime's voice actors Yui Ishikawa (Mikasa), Yuuki Kaji (Eren), Marina Inoue (Armin) and director Tetsuro Araki (pictured from left to right) appeared at the event. The group cut a large cake featuring the Colossal Titan.



The first compilation film's midnight premiere screenings also ended on Saturday with the same announcements. The two films compile the 2013 television anime series based on Hajime Isayama's manga, and are named after Linked Horizon's popular opening themes for the television anime.



Both Funimation and Crunchyroll streamed the first season as it aired in Japan, and Funimation released the series on home video this year.



The main cast members for the live-action Attack on Titan films were unveiled in costume on Wednesday. Shinji Higuchi is directing two films that are slated to premiere in Japan next summer. With the supervision of Isayama, the story will be based on the world and characters of the manga, while incorporating new characters and new formidable enemies.



Update: More details and background information added.
